# OBJECTIVE 🏅

The objective of the project is based on the layout of a landing page following the visual guidelines of a given user interface. Also complying with playback and adaptation functionalities to different browsers and devices.

# PREPARATION ⚙️

1- Review each requirement established for the delivery of the project.
2- Create a "kanban" board to organize myself and manage time. In which I also began to establish the way to carry out the project.
3- Download the resources provided for the project.
4- Create the folder and the files (HTML and CSS).
5- Configure initial styles.

In this last step the configuration was the following:

*{
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
box-sizing: border-box;
}*

# DEVELOPMENT 👨🏽‍💻

1-I established a general container so that it is the only thing that depends on the BODY. And I determined a container for each identified section, so that I could then work inside each one separately.

2-I made a CSS style sheet for each section of the landing page, because that way I could move anywhere to make changes more quickly.

3-I used the icons from ▶︎Fontawesome and the fonts from ▶︎Google Font

4- I added a colored border to the elements that I was interested in observing their size and behavior so that it would be easier for me to visually arrange them. I left them until the end of the project and then removed them.

# DIFFICULTIES 📕

The main obstacle that I faced was that I started with a "desktop-first" design and that brought me some problems when interacting with the media queries. So I decided to start the project again by adopting a "mobile-first" design and that way I was able to solve it.

# TOOLS USED 🛠️

▶︎ HTML

▶︎ CSS

# CONCLUSION 📃

1- Starting with a "mobile-first" design is simpler.

2- HTML semantics are a bit messy and could be better used to provide more accessibility and functionality.
Also...using "PIXELS" as a unit of measurement in some cases ruins accessibility and responsiveness, so it's better to
use relative units of measurement such as "REM".

3- NEVER be afraid to "start over", sometimes that path ends up teaching you a lot.
